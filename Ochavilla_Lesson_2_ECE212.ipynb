As a result, finding the distance between two points on the surface of the Earth is more complicated than simply using the Pythagorean theorem. Let (t1, g1) and (t2, g2) be the latitude and longitude of two points on the Earth’s surface. \n    The distance between these points, following the surface of the Earth, in kilometers is: distance = 6371.01 × arccos(sin(t1) × sin(t2) + cos(t1) × cos(t2) × cos(g1 − g2)) The value 6371.01 in the previous equation wasn’t selected at random. \n    It is the average radius of the Earth in kilometers.\n   ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from math import radians, cos, sin, asin, sqrt\ndef distance (lat1, lat2, lon1, lon2):\n\n    lon1 = radians(lon1)\n    lon2 = radians(lon2)\n    lat1 = radians(lat1)\n    lat2 = radians(lat2)\n\n    dlon = lon2 - lon1\n    dlat = lat2 - lat1\n    a = sin(dlat / 2)**2 + cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * sin(dlon / 2)**2\n\n    c = 2 * asin(sqrt(a))\n\n    r = 6371\n\n    return(c * r)\n\n\nlat1 = 53.32055555555556\nlat2 = 53.31861111111111\nlon1 = -1.7297222222222221\nlon2 = -1.69972222222222223\nprint(distance(lat1, lat2, lon1, lon2), 'K.M')","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"2.004367838271627 K.M\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
