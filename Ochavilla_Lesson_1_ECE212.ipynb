Python upholds modules and bundles, which encourages program particularity and code reuse. The Python translator and the broad standard library are accessible in source or paired structure without charge for every single significant stage, and can be uninhibitedly disseminated\n\nSo in this lesson, this coursepack will show us how to comprehend and make program in Python. Understanding computer programs requires algorithmic, unthinking reasoning. In this way, understanding computer codes includes a great deal of mental recreation of what will really occur, not what you wish would happen. This additionally requires innovative critical thinking, this implies the capacity to plan, ponder arrangements, and express it unmistakably and precisely."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Activity\n\n#### 1.) Why do you think understanding computer programs is relevant in our time today especially in the new normal?\n\nI think understanding PC programs is important presently today particularly in the new ordinary as Steve Jobs once stated, \"Everyone in this nation ought to figure out how to program a PC since it shows you how to think.\" Computer programing is a hugely versatile device that you can use to do shocking things that are by and large either manual and laborsome or are essentially extraordinary. PC programming makes things simpler for us, by coding it creates organized and inventive deduction, and by learning programs it instructs us to be tenacious. Particularly in this new ordinary phase of life, writing computer programs is benevolent the pertinent to us all. Since we are restricted to get things done external our premises, we will in general trade off it by utilizing our advanced contraptions. In this new stage, we will in general learn courses on the web and think innovatively on making our online life partner and energizing.\n\n#### 2.) If you were able to learn computer program, what program will you code? Why?\n\nIn the event that I had the option to learn PC program, I think I'll stick on learning python. As it was said that Python language isn't just an elevated level programming language but on the other hand is adaptable and it is additionally being instructed right now.\n\n#### 3.) What would be your pirmary motivation in learning programming?\n\nMy essential inspiration would be this will help us a great deal in evaluating our career later on. Beside that, this new ordinary situation could likewise help in empowering on confronting exercises that bargains on PCs.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Application"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Ask Yourself:\n\n#### 1.) Why do you think Python is the most applicable programming language for scientific computing?\n\nProgramming dialects have been around for a long time, and dependably watches the dispatch of another dialects significantly motivating fashioners. Python is quickly ascending to the bleeding edge of the most standard programming dialects on the planet and its exceptional advancement is indisputably showed up on Stock Overflow than other programming dialects. Why Python? Composing Python code is straightforward which rates up progress beside that perusing Python code is in like manner regular. Most importantly, Python additionally gives us endeavored and attempted flexibility. This makes Python confirmation perhaps the most looked in the wake of programming accreditations.\n\n#### 2.) If Python can build anything, where do you think Python is not applicable for?\n\nDisregarding the way that Python can construct anything, there are moreover a couple of shortcomings. Python has moderate execution speed, which infers it works with a mediator, and not with a compiler. Python executes more delayed than C, C++, Java and various dialects. Second, it has tremendous memory use, accordingly it isn't sensible to use for development under confined memory restriction. Third, it isn't sensible for Mobile and Game improvement on account of the usage of more memory and its moderate taking care of speed appeared differently in relation to other programming tongues. Ultimately, it is difficult to test, since it is a mediator based language, it is hard to run tests on code written in Python."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Exercises"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Exercise 1: Mailing Address (Solved, 9 Lines)\n\nCreate a program that displays your name and complete mailing addresss.
